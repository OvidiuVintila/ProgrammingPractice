# ProgrammingPractice

## 01_Basic_Exercises
#### Exercise_01
*Python*
>Store a message in a variable, and then print that message.
#### Exercise_02
*Python*
>Store a message in a variable, and print that message.<br />
>Then change the value of your variable to a new message, and print the new message.
#### Exercise_03
*Python*
>Store a person’s name in a variable, and print a message to that person. Your message should be simple, such as, “Hello Eric, 
>would you like to learn some code today?”
#### Exercise_04
*Python*
>Store a person’s name in a variable, and then print that person’s name in lowercase, uppercase, and titlecase. <br />
#### Exercise_05
*Python*
>Find a quote from a famous person you admire. Print the quote and the name of its author. <br />
>Your output should look something like the following, including the quotation marks:<br />
>Albert Einstein once said, “A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.”<br />

## 02_Data_Structures
### 01_Lists
#### Exercise_01
*Python*
>Store the names of a few of your friends in a list called names. <br />
>Print each person’s name by accessing each element in the list, one at a time.<br />
>Use the list above but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. <br />
>The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.<br />
>Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. <br />
>Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”<br />

#### Exercise_02
*Python*
>Think of at least three kinds of your favorite pizza. Store these pizza names in a list, and then use a for loop to print the name of each pizza. <br />
> Modify your for loop to print a sentence using the name of the pizza instead of printing just the name of the pizza. For each pizza you should have one line of output containing a simple statement like I like pepperoni pizza.<br />
>Add a line at the end of your program, outside the for loop, that states how much you like pizza. 

#### Exercise_03
*Python*
>Make a list of the first 10 square numbers.

### 02_Tuples
#### Exercise_01
*Python*
>A buffet-style restaurant offers only five basic foods. Think of five simple foods, and store them in a tuple.<br />
>•	 Use a for loop to print each food the restaurant offers.<br />
>•	 Try to modify one of the items, and make sure that Python rejects the change.<br />
>•	 The restaurant changes its menu, replacing two of the items with different foods. <br />
>Add a block of code that rewrites the tuple, and then use a for loop to print each of the items on the revised menu.<br />


## 03_Control_Flow
#### Exercise_01
*Python*
>Make a list of five or more usernames, including the name  'admin'. Imagine you are writing code that will <br />
>print a greeting to each user after they log in to a website. <br />
>Loop through the list, and print a greeting to each user:<br />
>•	 If the username is 'admin', print a special greeting, such as Hello admin, would you like to see a status report?<br />
>•	 Otherwise, print a generic greeting, such as Hello Eric, thank you for logging in again.<br />
#### Exercise_02
*Python*
>Make a list of five or more usernames called current_users.<br />
>•	 Make another list of five usernames called new_users. Make sure one or  two of the new usernames are also in the current_users list.<br />
>•	 Loop through the new_users list to see if each new username has already been used. If it has, print a message that the person will need to enter a <br />
>new username. If a username has not been used, print a message saying that the username is available.<br />
>•	 Make sure your comparison is case insensitive. If 'John' has been used, 'JOHN' should not be accepted.<br />

#### Exercise_03
*Python*
>Make a list called sandwich_orders and fill it with the names of vari-ous sandwiches .<br />
>Then make an empty list called finished_sandwiches . Loop through the list of sandwich orders and print a message for each order,<br />
>such as I made your tuna sandwich. <br />
>As each sandwich is made, move it to the list of finished sandwiches . <br />
>After all the sandwiches have been made, print a message listing each sandwich that was made .<br />

## 04_Functions
#### Exercise_01
*Python*
>Write a function called display_message() that prints one sen-<br />
>tence telling everyone what you are learning about in this chapter . Call the <br />
>function, and make sure the message displays correctly .<br />
*Exercise found in book Python Crash Course , Eric Matthes, page 135*

#### Exercise_02
*Python*
>Write a function called favorite_book() that accepts one <br />
>parameter, title . The function should print a message, such as One of my <br />
>favorite books is Alice in Wonderland . Call the function, making sure to <br />
>include a book title as an argument in the function call .<br />
*Exercise found in book Python Crash Course , Eric Matthes, page 135*

#### Exercise_03
*Python*
>Write a function called make_shirt() that accepts a size and the <br />
>text of a message that should be printed on the shirt . The function should print <br />
>a sentence summarizing the size of the shirt and the message printed on it .<br />
>Call the function once using positional arguments to make a shirt . Call the <br />
>function a second time using keyword arguments .<br />
