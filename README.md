#### Exercise_05
Find a quote from a famous person you admire. Print the quote and the name of its author. 
Your output should look something like the following, including the quotation marks:
Albert Einstein once said, “A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.”
#### Exercise_06
Store the names of a few of your friends in a list called names. Print 
each person’s name by accessing each element in the list, one at a time.
Greetings: Start with the list you used in Exercise 3-1, but instead of just 
printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the 
person’s name.
Your Own List: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a 
motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list 
to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a 
Honda motorcycle.”
